All inner feelings cannot be\\nexpressed in words. Some can be told, some are\\nexpressed through the body language, and the rest are to\\nbe realized which can only be understood by a seeker\\nthrough inner experiences. Only after attaining the state\\nwhich Lord Krishn had been to, an accomplished teacher\\nknows what the Geeta says. He simply does not reiterate\\nverses of the Geeta but, in fact, gives expression to the\\ninner feelings of the Geeta.
